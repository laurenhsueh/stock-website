    <h1>Media Coverage and the Stock Market</h1>
    <p>
      How do the sentiment and volume of media correlate with short-term movements in specific stock markets? In today’s world, everyone is connected through fast-moving media. It is important to consider how this has impacted larger trends, such as economics and the stock market.

    <h1>Our Pivot</h1>
    <div id="stonksContainer">
      <p>We originally used index funds like QQQ to explore whether media coverage had an influence on market behavior. However, after conducting further research and analyzing our initial results, we decided to pivot our focus to a specific stock. Index funds represent the overall health of the economy by tracking a broad range of companies, which makes them less susceptible to short-term media influence. In contrast, individual stocks, especially high-profile ones, can be more directly impacted by media discourse. We chose Tesla as our subject because it consistently generates significant media attention and public conversation. This makes us curious to investigate whether media narratives correlate with fluctuations in Tesla’s stock price, and to what extent sentiment and coverage might drive market movement.</p>
