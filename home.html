    <h1>Media Coverage and the Stock Market</h1>
    <p>
      How do the sentiment and volume of media correlate with short-term movements in specific stock markets? In today’s world, everyone is connected through fast-moving media. It is important to consider how this has impacted larger trends, such as economics and the stock market.

    <h1>Our Pivot</h1>
    <div id="stonksContainer">
      <p>We originally used index funds like QQQ to explore whether media coverage had an influence on market behavior. However, after conducting further research and analyzing our initial results, we decided to pivot our focus to a specific stock. Index funds represent the overall health of the economy by tracking a broad range of companies, which makes them less susceptible to short-term media influence. In contrast, individual stocks, especially high-profile ones, can be more directly impacted by media discourse. We chose Tesla as our subject because it consistently generates significant media attention and public conversation. This makes us curious to investigate whether media narratives correlate with fluctuations in Tesla’s stock price, and to what extent sentiment and coverage might drive market movement.</p>

      <h3>Media Correlates with Market Behavior</h3>
      <p>
        Media sentiment and volume, particularly from high-engagement sources, are assumed to correlate 
        with short-term stock price and volatility changes, influencing investor behavior.

      <h3>High-Engagement Posts Drive Market Movements</h3>
      <p>
        High-engagement posts (e.g., upvotes, impressions) and influential figures (e.g., Elon Musk, Trump) 
        are assumed to have a stronger impact on market movements due to their reach and public profiles.

    <h1>Core Data Assertions</h1>

    <div class="assertationCard">
      <h3>1. Negative sentiment in media consistently aligns with short-term stock price declines</h3>
      <p>
        The Extreme Sentiment Days Analysis chart shows that when Reddit sentiment was extremely negative, Tesla’s stock often dropped significantly the next day. In contrast, positive sentiment days were followed by a mix of neutral or positive. This makes it clear that very negative Reddit activity is more likely to lead to sharp price changes, especially in a downward direction. This also reflects the dynamics discussed in the "Reddit Revolt" article about GameStop in The Journal of Finance, where highly charged and coordinated sentiment on r/wallstreetbets directly influenced large institutional market reactions. It reinforces that extreme sentiment on Reddit can indeed drive tangible price movements, especially when driven by collective behavior.

      <h3>2. Extreme sentiment on Reddit, especially when highly negative, is followed by sharp market reactions</h3>
      <p>
        Using the Sentiment Strength vs. Price Volatility charts, we can see how there’s somewhat of a link between strong emotional sentiment and how much Tesla’s stock price moved during the day, but overall, there wasn’t a strong or consistent partner. This means emotional media might increase volatility sometimes, but it doesn’t guarantee a big price swing. This aligns with research by Wan et al., which identifies correlations between sentiment shifts and stock volatility across large datasets of news. Their findings similarly caution that while sentiment contributes to volatility, the relationship is complex and inconsistent across time, suggesting the need for more nuanced models of media influence.

      <h3>4. Trading volume often spikes alongside Reddit activity, but not Musk tweets</h3>
      <p>
        Our comparison between Reddit comment volume and tweet frequency versus trading volume reveals a stronger relationship between Reddit engagement and trading spikes. Musk’s tweets, while emotionally charged, don’t consistently trigger volume changes, suggesting Reddit’s collective activity may have a more tangible effect on market behavior. Research by the University of Warwick found that higher volumes of financial news coverage correlate with increased investor trading activity. Their study supports the idea that sheer quantity of media engagement, such as Reddit comment volume, can help explain spikes in trading volume even without a direct sentiment effect.
