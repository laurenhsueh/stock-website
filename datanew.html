            <p class="dinsight">Late Jan to Early March 2021:
                There's a high percentage of negative sentiment, and Tesla’s stock price declines during this time.
                → Suggests bearish sentiment aligned with price drop.
                
                Mid-March to Mid-May 2021:
                Sentiment remains mixed, with neutral dominating, and the stock stabilizes.
                → Possibly a cooling-off period on Reddit after initial hype.
                
                June–August 2021:
                Positive sentiment increases slightly, while negative sentiment persists but declines somewhat.
                Tesla’s price recovers and trends upward mildly.
                → A potential positive lagging effect or reduced bearish pressure.</p>

            <p class="dinsight">Observed Trends
                Positive Sentiment (right side of the graph)
                
                Tends to be followed by positive or neutral next-day price moves
                
                A few cases show >3% gains after high sentiment days
                
                But not all high-sentiment days lead to price increases — some even lead to negative returns.
                
                Negative Sentiment (left side)
                
                Often followed by sharp next-day drops (up to -5% or -6%)
                
                More consistent correlation here: very negative days often precede losses</p>
        </div>

        <div id="wkdata3" class="dstep">
            <p class="dinsight">Little to no correlation</p>
        </div>

        <div id="wkdata4" class="dstep">
            <p class="dinsight">1. No Consistent Lead-Lag Relationship
                Sometimes sentiment increases before a price rise (e.g., late May), suggesting possible predictive power.
                
                But in many other cases, price and sentiment diverge, or sentiment is reactive (i.e., it shifts after price moves).
                
                2. High Volatility in Sentiment
                Sentiment spikes up and down frequently, even when price is relatively flat (e.g., July 2021). This suggests Reddit sentiment is noisy and possibly influenced by non-price-related factors like memes, hype, or unrelated market chatter.
                
                3. General Trend Decoupling
                From April to August, average sentiment remains mostly elevated, while the stock price moves sideways to slightly down.
                
                This decoupling suggests that high average sentiment doesn't always translate into upward price momentum.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="wkdata5" class="dstep">
            <p class="dinsight">Insights & Trends
                Positive Correlation Trend (Weak but Present):
                
                As sentiment increases toward the right (more positive), there’s a slight increase in the concentration of green dots (positive returns).
                
                Conversely, more red dots cluster near the left (negative sentiment), especially around and below 0.
                
                Most Negative Returns Cluster Near Neutral Sentiment:
                
                Many price drops occur even at mild-to-moderate sentiment levels (0.10–0.25).
                
                This suggests sentiment might not always provide enough momentum or signal strength on its own to predict up or down moves.
                
                Outliers:
                
                There's a massive outlier at ~0.18 sentiment and +20% next-day return — likely an unusual spike driven by a major event.
                
                These rare extremes skew visual interpretation but highlight that sentiment spikes can occasionally align with major moves.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="wkdata6" class="dstep">
            <p class="dinsight">Volatility in Sentiment

                Sentiment is highly volatile, with frequent sharp swings day-to-day.
                
                This volatility often does not translate into corresponding price shifts, weakening its predictive power.
                
                Possible Local Correlations
                
                In some time windows (e.g., early March, mid-May), a drop in sentiment seems to precede or accompany price declines, but these are infrequent and not reliably spaced.
                
                You’d need statistical lag correlation tests (e.g., cross-correlation functions) to determine whether any meaningful lag exists.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="wkdata7" class="dstep">
            <p class="dinsight">Key Observations
                Spike Alignment
                
                There are multiple points where comment spikes align with volume surges:
                
                Most notably in late January, early March, and early August, both trading volume and Reddit comments spike simultaneously.
                
                This implies Reddit hype may amplify market participation, likely from retail traders.
                
                Asymmetry in Influence
                
                Some volume spikes occur without a Reddit comment spike, suggesting other factors (e.g., earnings reports, macro events) also drive trading volume.
                
                But every major comment spike seems to coincide with higher volume, which supports the idea that Reddit chatter contributes to increased trading activity, especially on the retail side.
                
                Lag Not Obvious
                
                There’s no clear lag (e.g., Reddit comments leading volume by a day or two). Peaks tend to happen concurrently.
                </p>
        </div>

        <div id="wkdata8" class="dstep">
            <p class="dinsight">No strong correlation
                Key Observations
                Some Co-movement in Peaks
                
                Several high sentiment intensity days (red peaks above 0.7–0.8) occur alongside or just before volume surges (e.g., early February, mid-March, late April).
                
                Suggests that emotionally charged days, whether bullish or bearish, may draw more trader attention.
                
                Diminishing Volume Over Time
                
                While extreme sentiment remains relatively elevated and volatile throughout, trading volume trends downward across the timeline.
                
                This implies that emotional intensity remains, but market participation fades — possibly due to fading hype or exhaustion in retail activity.
                
                Divergence in Mid–Late Summer
                
                From June to August, many high-sentiment days don’t correspond with volume spikes, breaking the earlier pattern.
                
                Suggests that sentiment alone isn't enough to sustain volume; the novelty or urgency of the narrative may matter more.</p>
